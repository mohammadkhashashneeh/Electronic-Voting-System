        <p >The Independent Election Commission was established in 2012 as an independent body concerned with managing and supervising the electoral process without interference or influence from any party. The Commission is one of the fruits of political reform in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan under the leadership of His Majesty King Abdullah II Ibn Al Hussein, and expresses the official institution's response to popular demands.
The commission was established with the aim of ensuring the holding of parliamentary elections in line with international standards, in a manner that guarantees the restoration of citizenâ€™s confidence in the electoral process and its outcomes, addressing the negative accumulations of the past and building on the achievements and reform steps that have been achieved.
The commission started its work in May 2012 and was able, during a record period, to work on building its institutional structure, providing guarantees of its sustainability, and preparing for holding the elections of the seventeenth Jordanian Parliament, which took place in early 2013 as the first elections run by the commission after its establishment.
In 2014, according to the constitutional amendments, the role and responsibilities of the Independent Election Commission were expanded to include the management of municipal elections and any general elections, in addition to the administration and supervision of any other elections entrusted to it by the government, in a manner that guarantees the highest levels of transparency, integrity and impartiality in managing the various electoral processes .
The commission then supervised a number of by-elections, municipal council elections and the Greater Amman Municipality Council, which the government implemented in August 2013.
